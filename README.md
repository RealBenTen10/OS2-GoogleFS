Sorry, I couldn't make it work

I can deploy the master server, but the connection doesn't work.

I do not understand what exactly I am doing wrong.

The Chunk Server can't register with the Master Server.

The test weren't helpful - unfortunately.

What did I do wrong?

I only need 5 more points and I plan to submit the last task as well.

Please make some superficial "debugging" such that I can understand my error with connecting the Server and Client.

Kind regards
